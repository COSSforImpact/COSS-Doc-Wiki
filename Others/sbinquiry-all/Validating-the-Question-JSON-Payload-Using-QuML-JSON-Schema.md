This is a write up to demonstrate how we can validate any given JSON payload against a well defined schema corresponding to it.

Idea here is to see if we can run this application against an identified question payload with its corresponding JSON schema.

This will help us uncover the current deviations and can become as a repeatable test to see if the sample payload adhere to the specification.


### A video recording of the test carried out is embedded here.

### Sample code used for test is here

### Observation

* There are deviations from the QuML (v1) specification in the inQuiry


* Corrective action to fix the existing payload needs to be taken and re-validated against the specification. 


* Assuming similar deviations may be there from other adopters as well.
