This category leverages  _simple choice_  and  _multiple choice_  interaction. Only  _simple choice_  is supported in Sunbird 3.9.

As a creator I should be able to create Multiple Choice Question


* with at least 2 and maximum 8 options


* mark any or none of the options as correct


    * Marking an option as correct will set its score as 1. In future we will enable editing of score for each option



    


## Multiple choice with multiple correct answers (MMCQ)

* Creator can mark more than one answers as correct. 


    * On marking an answer as correct, its weightage is set as 1. Which means on selecting this response, the player will get full marks allotted for the question



    
* The number of options that can be selected by  the Player will be the total number of correct answers marked.

    Example,


```
MCQ with one correct answer.
Q: What is 2 +2 ?
a)4 (marked as correct answer)
b)8-2
c)2*2
d)8

In this case the user will be allowed to choose only one option from the 4 options available.This works like a normal MCQ.

MMCQ with 2 correct answers.
Q: What is 2 +2 ?
a)4 (marked as correct answer)
b)8/2 (marked as correct answer)
c)2*2
d)8

In this case the user will be allowed to choose only two options from the 4 options available.
```



* There is no logical difference between the two questions types as MCQ & MMCQ. MCQ question is an MMCQ question with just one correct answer. The two of them will be considered as a single question type only.


* MCQ (or any question) with multiple correct answers will have Scoring Logic = PARTIAL by default. Thus, 


    * All responses marked as correct will get equal marks.The total marks of the question will be divided equally amongst all responses


    * Player will get the score for whichever option s/he has selected. 



    


### Scoring Logic

* A Scoring Logic can have the following values:


    * ALL


    * Full marks assigned only when all the correct options are selected



    
    * ANY


    * Full marks assigned when any one of the correct answers is selected



    
    * PARTIAL


    * Partial scores assigned of any one or more correct answers entered.The total marks of the question will be divided equally amongst all response.

* Questions which are part of any question setÂ  will have the effective Scoring Logic set at the immediate parent level.


    * If questions are present in a section (within a question set), the Scoring Logic of the section will be applied for all the questions in the section.


    * If the question set does not contain any sections and the questions are the immediate children, the Scoring Logic of the question set will be inherited to the questions within.



    
* Default value of Scoring Logic will be PARTIAL




### Assumptions:

* There is no negative marking. Score is always positive. 


    * In future, Score can be any number, system will award whether it is positive or negative.



    
* While shuffle is turned on, all questions in a question-set will be assigned score as 1, which is handled at the Player end, without modifying the maxScore in the metadata.


    * We will stick to the same logic for MMCQ



    


### User flow

* As a creator, I will create MCQ, enter options, and mark some of the options as correct. 


* When an option is marked as correct, system by default gives it a score of 1. This means that all options carry equal weightage when marked as correct.


    * In future, there will be an option to edit option level score. 



    
* Scoring logic will be set as PARTIAL by default. Scoring logic can be made ALL ,or ANY based on the scoring logic that has to be followed.
