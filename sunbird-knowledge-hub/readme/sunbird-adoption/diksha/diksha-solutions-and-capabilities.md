   * **Mobile, Portal, and Desktop Apps**: Support online and offline learning, multilingual access, and are accessible across different devices.
   * **Sourcing Portal**: Allows for controlled, crowdsourced contributions of educational content, supporting over 220,000 contents from 11,000+ contributors.
6. **Core Services and Capabilities**: DIKSHA’s backend uses multiple microservices for asset management, telemetry, notifications, and taxonomy frameworks. It supports multi-tenancy, offline access, search, multilingual UI, content download, and progress tracking.
7. **Resources and Training**: The document lists various resources, including DIKSHA’s help center, capability mapping, and instructional content. Links are provided for webinars on Sunbird’s architecture, data analytics, and specific DIKSHA features.
