### Expected outcomes of Design System project <a href="#id-7br18uysmm5v" id="id-7br18uysmm5v"></a>

### Goals / outcomes <a href="#xessgnah0wpy" id="xessgnah0wpy"></a>

* Consistent experience language throughout all pages of the portal so that users’ don’t need a learning curve with every new feature added.
  * Identify templates based on task for a persona. E.g. Search for something - users to add to a batch, content to add to a textbook, add image to a slide, or content for myself.
  * Consistent headers satisfying purpose of a persona - creator, consumer, course, etc
  * Cards to meet a purpose of user in a context
* Detailed style guide for all components and templates used in Sunbird Ed portal.
* Consistency in design language and user experience across the different consumption channels - web, mobile (and potentially, smart TV and others in the future).
* Standardisation of product UI text so that user has more contextual, meaningful and actionable messaging from system.
* Design considerations to be ingrained
  * Responsiveness to cater to website users on mobile web browser
  * Multilingual support
  * Device testing
  * Recommended resolution based on devices
  * UI language text or placeholder text as lorem ipsum
* Speed and ease of building new features
  * Decouple UI component from functional feature code (API based integration)
* Pixel perfect or high fidelity design implementation
  * Design is based on a design language & system
  * Dev team has right tools to extract design spec
  * Sensitisation of both teams to deliver this jointly

### Process <a href="#nx9l8au4trxg" id="nx9l8au4trxg"></a>

* Design team should deliver required designs on time and should adhere to a project management process.
  * Regular check-in or showcase to Product, Tech managers, Tech design, Tech writer, etc
* Design release & sign-off. Any feedback post sign-off can be scheduled later. Minor changes can be accommodated on-the-fly, if possible.
  * Sign-off by Design lead + PM + Tech writer
* UI team to develop CSS/HTML and get a sign off from Product Design team before integrating the designs with product functionality.
  * UAT on CSS / HTML built
* There is a common, agreed upon repository and tool identified for sharing designs between Product Design, Product, UI and Engineering teams.
* Designer should start creating from existing and available components. This will ensure speed of development and consistency is achieved. If required, new components can be introduced after reviewing with Tech & Product design teams along with Product team.
* Design revisions
  * Once signed-off, will be handed over to Dev
  * During Dev no changes expected (unless minor)
  * Any changes to be scheduled later
  * Zeplin maintains a version that can be backtraced?
* Design should begin with an existing base and should be in-sync with dev or there is design debt logged
* Dedicated designer per product / solution

Simulate all processes with tools to ensure everyone has understood and will adhere to the process.
