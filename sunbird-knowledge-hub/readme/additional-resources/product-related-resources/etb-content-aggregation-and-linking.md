# ETB Content Aggregation and Linking

ETB Content Aggregation and Linking

### Overview <a href="#ilzx05te2it0" id="ilzx05te2it0"></a>

This document describes the process workflow of aggregating and linking content to Textbooks with DIAL codes to create energized textbooks by states and center. Based on the process, product specifications are derived and detailed.

### Process <a href="#nvavow4ib056" id="nvavow4ib056"></a>

Content aggregation happens through three different channels - Centre, State and Others. As part of the content aggregation, the channels might also create textbooks and link content to them.

However, creation of an official textbook and linking content to the official textbook is owned by individual state. The official textbook will have DIAL codes linked to its chapters or topics/subtopics within the chapters. These are the DIAL codes printed on the textbooks published by the states and hence the content linked to the official textbook will be the content shown when DIAL code is scanned.
