# Design System Request

### Design Guidelines Request \[PHASE 1] <a href="#mwii3tj4sw6u" id="mwii3tj4sw6u"></a>

**To:** Subu

**From:** Namrita and Suren

**What:**

* A detailed style guide for DIKSHA **web portal** (for reference: [Lonely Planet](https://rizzo.lonelyplanet.com/styleguide/design-elements/colours), [Atlassian](https://atlassian.design/guidelines/product/overview))

Which contains the following:

* Building blocks of design (font and typography, colours, branding)
* All [components](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfmYimP\_njvGharEq9Ce98aRQUu1c9CO6UckAUyQfmM/edit#gid=0) and their variations
  * Empty, overflowing, ideal
  * Indian languages & Urdu (RTL)
  * Responsiveness to various devices & resolutions
* [Templates and layouts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MfmYimP\_njvGharEq9Ce98aRQUu1c9CO6UckAUyQfmM/edit#gid=0)
* Mockups using the style guide in DIKSHA context for all pages affected
* All designs should be shared and managed in a tool of your choice (like Invision)

**When:**

* Weekly deliverables of style guide for development team with a couple of components/templates
* Weekly showcases to product managers to gather feedback
* Validated and shared full style guide for all existing components and templates by **Feb 20**

**Why (For the sake of what?):**

* Consistent experience language throughout all pages of the portal so that users’ don’t need a learning curve with every new feature added.
* Consistency in design language and user experience across the different consumption channels - web, mobile (and potentially, smart TV and others in the future)
* Speed and ease of building new features
  * Designers have a base to start from when they build new screens/flows
  * Engineering can churn out features faster as components don’t always have to be built from scratch
* With the basic elements worked out, design team can spend more time understand our user and design elements to be focused on.

### \[PHASE 2] Overall DIKSHA design thinking <a href="#id-74a113snuq6d" id="id-74a113snuq6d"></a>

**Design Guidelines - taking it forward.**

Learning Session / Brainstorm

**What does design guidelines mean to you?**

I feel that the guidelines will help the design team set design standards, and fundamental experiences are streamlined.

**How do you see it affecting our product?**

The user experience will be constantly enhanced and we would be able to react to feedbacks, faster and be focused. Habit building.

**How will it affect your work?**

Our eye for detail will get sharper, we could spend more time understand our user and design elements we focus on.

**Why / What / How**

**Why -** continuous improvement of the user experience / ascetics / visual / DIKSHA experience

**What -** an organic guideline / elasticity

**How** - we will do in stages / sensitive to the user and their experience
