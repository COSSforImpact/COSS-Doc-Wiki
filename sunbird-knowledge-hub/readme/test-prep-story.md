### Overview

The document outlines a test preparation initiative aimed at helping 10th-grade students prepare for board exams, focusing on providing high-quality and trusted content, including question sets and solutions, via the **DIKSHA platform**. The program targets several stakeholder groups, each facing unique challenges:

1. **Students**:
   * Struggle to find trusted, high-quality, and timely resources.
   * Need accessible solutions and explanations to improve confidence.
2. **Teachers**:
   * Struggle to provide diverse, high-quality questions and solutions.
   * Face difficulty in aligning content with students' preparation needs.
3. **State Administrators**:
   * Lack visibility into students’ preparation levels and challenges.
   * Need data-driven insights for targeted interventions.

**Solution Design**

The initiative leverages the **DIKSHA platform** to address these issues:

1. **Content Development**:
   * Existing question sets prepared by state education boards were digitized and uploaded to DIKSHA.
   * Teachers and experts created solution videos for each question.
   * QR codes in textbooks provided direct access to content.
   * Weekly updates ensured fresh and relevant content aligned with chapters.
2. **Process Flow**:
   * Questions and solutions were reviewed, uploaded, and linked to QR codes in textbooks.
   * Coordinators and subject-specific teachers collaborated to create and distribute content.
3. **Implementation Scope**:
   * Covered four subjects: Math, Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences.
   * Offered in two languages: English and Telugu.
   * Program duration: 5 weeks, with weekly releases of new content covering all chapters.

**User Experience**

* Students and teachers could scan QR codes to access MCQ-based content and explanation videos.
* Reports provided actionable insights to administrators about content usage and student performance.

**Feedback and Insights**

* **Positive Outcomes**:
  * Students found the platform useful for quick reference and grasping concepts via videos.
  * Enhanced student confidence and skill development, especially for Biology and Physics.
  * Improved collaboration between Telugu and English medium students.
* **Challenges Identified**:
  * Telugu medium content lacked quality; students preferred English medium materials.
  * Limited offline access due to reliance on YouTube-hosted videos.
  * Students requested additional formats, such as 2-mark questions and bit banks.
  * Teachers suggested reordering videos and questions for better engagement.

**Key Findings (Data Analysis)**

* Total user base: 8,142 users.
* Content scanned 15,590 times; 71,864 sessions logged, with 73.9% on the DIKSHA app.
* Average response time for first attempts: 31 seconds.
* Only 49% of users answered correctly on the first attempt.

**Future Enhancements**

* Focus on improving content quality, especially for Telugu medium.
