### Overview

The document provides a detailed overview of the Kubernetes cluster setup and autoscaling mechanisms implemented for the Diksha project. Here's a breakdown:

#### 1. **Kubernetes Overview**

* The document explains Kubernetes concepts such as:
  * **Daemon Set:** Ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all or some specific nodes.
  * **Replica Set & Replication Controller:** Manage the number of pod replicas to maintain availability.
  * **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):** Adjusts the number of pods based on CPU/memory metrics.
  * **Cluster Autoscaler:** Provisions new nodes when existing nodes cannot schedule new pods.

#### 2. **Autoscaling Approaches**

* **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:**
  * Based on CPU consumption.
  * Configured with thresholds for each service.
  * Includes minimum and maximum replica counts.
* **Cluster Autoscaler:**
  * Activated when pods remain in a pending state due to lack of resources.
  * Adds new nodes dynamically.

#### 3. **Metrics and Monitoring**

* **Key Dashboards and Exporters:**
  * **Node Exporter:** Monitors host details like CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic.
  * **Process Exporter:** Tracks CPU, memory, and I/O metrics for processes.
  * **Redis Exporter:** Monitors Redis-specific metrics like memory usage and key expiration.
  * **Kafka Exporter:** Tracks Kafka performance metrics, including partition details and input/output rates.
  * **ElasticSearch Exporter:** Provides data on cluster status, shard details, and query rates.
  * **Fluent Bit Exporter:** Captures cluster logging metrics.

#### 4. **Configuration and Parameters**

* Configurable settings include:
  * **Service-level HPA thresholds.**
  * **CPU and memory resource requests/limits.**
  * **Minimum and maximum replicas.**
  * **Minimum and maximum nodes for cluster autoscaling.**

#### 5. **Key Features**

* **Autoscaling Rules:**
  * Benchmarked thresholds ensure optimal resource utilization.
  * Modular setup for scalability with service-specific configurations.
* **Dashboard Capabilities:**
  * Enable/disable HPA.
  * Set thresholds for CPU/memory resources.
  * Visualize performance and scaling activities.

This document is a comprehensive guide for managing Kubernetes clusters with emphasis on scalability and resource monitoring for the Diksha project.
