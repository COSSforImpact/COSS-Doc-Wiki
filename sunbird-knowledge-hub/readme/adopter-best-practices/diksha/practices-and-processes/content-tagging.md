Content Tagging to a Curriculum

Product Primer

### Benefits Tagging? <a href="#hp2ebrknmiir" id="hp2ebrknmiir"></a>

Tagging content is essential for discovery of content by users, relevant to their context and needs. It provides information about what the content is and who can use it. A teacher creates or uploads a content that is related to certain topics in a curriculum. Tagging allows specifying that information so that anyone searching for the content related to those topics can find it. A content tagged correctly with the information has chance for more usage. It ensures that users use the platform more often because they find the most relevant & high quality content for their needs, with ease. Tagging enables following two areas of Curation:

**Enhance Discovery** - It’s benefit is to reduce the time it takes for a user to get to the content they want as per their need. This includes accessing content through Navigation and Search.

**Relevance** - It’s benefit is to provide users with content that they need in their context thereby making them use the platform more often.

### What to Tag? <a href="#id-8tv5jyubocsp" id="id-8tv5jyubocsp"></a>

Following fields provide information about the curriculum and topics, with increasingly specificity:

* Board - Education board for which the content is related to.
* Medium - Medium (language) of teaching
* Grade - Grade to which the content is related to.
* Subject - Subject to which the content is related to.
* Topics - Topics within the subject to which the content is related to.

### Where do the Tags come from? <a href="#id-6ptgtmgorh4w" id="id-6ptgtmgorh4w"></a>

The values for the tags come from a taxonomy that is part of the platform. The taxonomy defines set of tags and their values. Following figure depicts the structure of the taxonomy.

Each state can define its own taxonomy or use a common taxonomy such as NCERT.

Taxonomy also provides for linking equivalent terms within each topic or subtopic to specify synonyms and translations. This helps in searching relevant content across different mediums and boards. - April/May timeframe
