{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pbCA7kKKZpx6vz_FAepox1JHVpPynV7v/view?usp=sharing" %}

### Overview

**Support System Guidelines V3.0**, provides a comprehensive framework for establishing and managing a robust support ecosystem for large-scale educational initiatives, particularly those involving the DIKSHA platform. Here’s a detailed overview:

#### **1. Background**

* The guidelines address the critical need for a support system to assist users (primarily teachers) during the implementation of national and state-level educational programs like NISHTHA and other teacher training initiatives.
* Users often face process-related queries, which the state-level support system must resolve quickly to ensure smooth program execution.

#### **2. Objectives**

The document aims to:

1. Define processes for the smooth rollout of programs.
2. Empower State Project Management Units (PMUs) to make informed decisions about deploying support mechanisms.
3. Provide detailed information on the support ecosystem for better planning and execution.
4. Identify and involve all stakeholders in the support system.

#### **3. Essential Ingredients of the State Support System**

The three main pillars are:

* **Communication Clarity**: Clear messaging to teachers and stakeholders about program expectations, timelines, and processes.
* **Response Time**: Quick resolution of queries to enhance user satisfaction.
* **Collaboration Scope**: Platforms for teachers to discuss learnings and resolve doubts with mentors.

#### **4. Guidelines for Helpdesk Creation**

* Establishing an L1 (first-level) helpdesk team within states, trained in coordination with DIKSHA’s central helpdesk.
* Creating user-friendly reference materials (manuals and videos) in local languages for self-service.
* Maintaining a **Support Tracker** to log and manage tickets systematically.
* Helpdesk staff must be trained in specific areas such as course objectives, DIKSHA platform navigation, and program-specific details.

#### **5. Types of Support**

The support ecosystem comprises:

1. User manuals detailing processes.
2. Step-by-step "How To" videos.
3. A telephonic helpdesk for troubleshooting.
4. Assistance from experienced users (Champions) at cluster, block, or district levels.
5. In-person assistance from program experts.
6. Escalation to DIKSHA’s L2 (second-level) helpdesk for complex technical issues.

#### **6. Troubleshooting and Support Flow**

* A structured flowchart ensures smooth resolution of user issues by defining roles and escalation paths, from initial troubleshooting to higher-level interventions.

#### **7. WhatsApp-Based Support Structure**

* Many states already use hierarchical WhatsApp groups for communication, from state admins to teachers. This existing structure can be leveraged for disseminating information and resolving queries.

#### **8. RACI Matrix**

The RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) delineates roles and responsibilities across tasks like:

* Forming support desks.
* Conducting training sessions.
* Managing the support tracker.
* Escalating issues to DIKSHA’s helpdesk.
* Sharing resources and communicating with users.

#### Key Takeaways:

* The guidelines emphasize creating a user-centric support system by leveraging existing resources, training teams, and utilizing technology like WhatsApp groups.
* They outline a clear roadmap for state-level implementation while ensuring seamless coordination with the DIKSHA platform.

This document is crucial for states and stakeholders involved in implementing scalable educational initiatives, focusing on empowering users and ensuring operational efficiency.
