### Overview

The document, titled **"DIKSHA Support - S1 Process, Version 2.0 (Dec 2022)"**, outlines the structured procedure for handling Severity 1 (S1) issues raised via the Freshdesk tool, specifically for the DIKSHA platform. It provides a detailed guide for managing critical issues effectively, ensuring proper resolution and closure. Below is a summary of the content:

***

#### **Process Overview**

The S1 process is triggered by a Freshdesk ticket and concludes with its closure. It encompasses roles, responsibilities, and activities across six key stages:

1. **Issue Raised**
   * Validation and replication of the reported issue by the L1 Support Team.
   * Conversion of Freshdesk ticket into a DIKSHA Jira ticket.
2. **Severity Classification by L2 Support**
   * Validation of the issue severity (S1) using the rubric.
   * Provision of a workaround if available.
   * Updating Jira tickets as necessary.
3. **Priority Justification**
   * Triage calls involving key stakeholders to determine issue priority.
   * Documentation of decisions in the Jira ticket.
4. **ETA Confirmation**
   * Coordination with engineering/implementation teams to finalize the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for resolution.
   * Communication of ETA to the user.
5. **Solution**
   * Follow-up on the resolution and deployment by relevant coordinators.
   * Updating status in the Jira system.
6. **Closure of Issue**
   * Verification of resolution by the L2 Lead.
   * Communication of resolution to the user and closure of the Freshdesk ticket.

***

#### **Key Process Elements**

* **Scope:**\
  Restricted to Severity 1 issues raised via Freshdesk and classified by L2 Support.
* **Roles Involved:**\
  Includes L1 Support Team, L2 Support Team, S1 Coordinator, Engineering and Implementation Teams, and Program Representatives.
* **Boundaries:**\
  Begins with ticket creation and ends with ticket closure.

***

#### **L2 - S1 Rubric Criteria**

Defines exceptions and voting rights for Triage calls:

* Triage calls are time-bound to weekdays or the next working day.
* Weekend calls depend on participant availability.
* The process excludes final Jira ticket closure, which depends on root cause analysis (RCA).
* Decisions in Triage calls rely on votes from a maximum of five representatives.

***

#### **Process Metrics**

Key performance metrics include:

* **Accuracy on severity classification:** Should exceed 80%.
* **Variance on ETA during Triage:** Must not exceed 10%.

***

#### **Escalations**

* Issues in support, implementation, or NOC operations escalate to the DIKSHA Operations Head.
* Solution/engineering issues escalate to the DIKSHA Solutions Head.

The document serves as a comprehensive guide for structured issue resolution within the DIKSHA framework, prioritizing efficiency and accountability.&#x20;
