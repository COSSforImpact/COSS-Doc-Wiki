### Overview

The document describes the **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Process**, a quality management tool aimed at identifying and resolving issues to prevent their recurrence.&#x20;

#### Purpose:

1. Identify the root cause of a problem or non-conformance.
2. Suggest changes to eliminate the problem permanently through process improvements.

***

#### Scope:

The RCA process applies to specific trigger events and can be extended to other situations by notifying the Solutions Program Management team. **Mandatory triggers** include:

* **P1/S1 Bugs** in production.
* **Recurring defects** (detected twice or more in release testing).
* Recurring bugs in production (irrespective of severity, identified twice or more).
* Deployment issues.
* Metrics deviating from acceptable ranges (Lower Control Limit & Upper Control Limit).
* Ad hoc issues like failed migrations or environment unavailability.

***

#### Roles Involved:

* **Solution Program Management**
* **Release Manager**
* **Product Manager**
* **Tech Manager**
* **Tech Leads**

***

#### Process Boundaries:

* **Start:** At the end of a release cycle.
* **RCA Meetings:** Monthly, on the 4th Thursday.
* **End:** With the acceptance and implementation of corrective/preventive actions.

***

#### Process Stages:

1. **RCA Event Trigger:** Identifying an event requiring RCA.
2. **Identify Root Cause and Corrective Action:** Analyzing the problem to determine causes and corrective steps.
3. **Review and Approve Root Cause and Corrective Action:** Stakeholders validate and approve findings.
4. **Implement Action:** Execute corrective and preventive measures.
5. **Validate Results and Close:** Ensure results address the issue, marking the process's closure.

***

#### Inputs:

* Specific events like P1/S1 bugs, recurring defects, deployment issues, or metrics deviations.

#### Outputs:

* A documented list of corrective and preventive actions.

***

#### Key Activities:

* Stakeholders collaboratively analyze the issue to determine:
  * What happened.
  * How it happened.
  * Why it happened.
  * Develop preventive actions to avoid recurrence.

***

#### Exceptions:

There are **no exceptions** to this process.

***

This structured approach ensures robust quality management by identifying problems at their source and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences.

11. What activities are conducted at each stage of the RCA process?

***

#### Inputs and Outputs:

12. What are the inputs to the RCA process?
13. What are the expected outputs of the RCA process?

***

#### Triggers and Scenarios:

14. What are P1/S1 bugs, and how do they relate to RCA?
15. How does the RCA process handle recurring defects?
16. What is the process for addressing deployment issues?
17. How does the RCA process deal with metrics deviations?
18. What are examples of ad hoc issues that can trigger RCA?

***

#### Metrics and Exceptions:

19. Are there any exceptions to the RCA process?
20. Are there defined metrics for measuring the success of the RCA process?

***

#### Implementation and Follow-Up:

21. How are root causes and corrective actions reviewed and approved?
22. What actions are taken to ensure the RCA process leads to preventive measures?
23. How are results validated to confirm the process's effectiveness?

***

This comprehensive set of questions ensures a clear understanding of the RCA process, its purpose, and its application in quality management.
