### Overview

**"S2 Support Process"** outlines a structured approach for handling Severity 2 (S2) issues in the DIKSHA platform. It provides a clear framework for addressing and resolving these issues through specific roles, tools, and stages. Below is a detailed summary:

#### Overview:

* **Purpose**: To streamline the process of resolving S2 issues reported via the Freshdesk tool.
* **Version**: 2.0, December 2022.
* **Scope**: Limited to S2 tickets raised on Freshdesk for DIKSHA.
* **Participants**: L1 Support Team, L2 Support Team, Engineering Team, and Implementation Team.

#### Process Stages:

1. **Issue Raised**:
   * Triggered by a Freshdesk ticket.
   * L1 Support Team validates, verifies, and collects details.
   * If possible, issues are resolved; otherwise, they are escalated to Jira.
2. **Severity Classification by L2 Support**:
   * L2 team reviews and ensures the ticket qualifies as S2, using the S1 rubric for validation.
   * If applicable, workarounds are provided or the issue is resolved.
3. **Severity Justification**:
   * L2 Lead and Support Operations deliberate on severity to ensure correct prioritization.
4. **ETA Confirmation**:
   * Engineering team determines the timeline for resolution.
   * ETAs are communicated to users and updated in Jira (resolution within three releases is the target).
5. **Solution Implementation**:
   * Engineering and Implementation Teams deploy the solution.
   * Status updates are managed internally until closure.
6. **Closure of Issue**:
   * L2 Lead verifies the resolution.
   * L1 Support Team informs the user and confirms closure on Freshdesk.

#### Exceptions:

* Issues outside S2 (e.g., S1 or S3 tickets).
* Delayed planning by Circle owners.
* Changes in Circle composition or feature deprecation.

#### Metrics:

* Debugging accuracy of L2 team should exceed 90%.
* ETA variance during triage should remain within 10%.

#### Escalation:

* For operational issues: Contact DIKSHA Operations Head.
* For engineering/solution issues: Contact DIKSHA Solutions Head.

#### Tools:

* **Freshdesk**: Initial ticket logging and management.
* **Jira**: Detailed tracking and resolution of issues.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to ensuring S2 issues are resolved efficiently, with accountability at each stage, robust escalation mechanisms, and a focus on process metrics for continuous improvement.
