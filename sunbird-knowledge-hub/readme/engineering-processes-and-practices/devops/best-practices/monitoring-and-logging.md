{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tL4Fb9T5t9V65CPnDAafHVunp-LI8wlr/view?usp=sharing" %}

## **Overview**

* **Sunbird Subsystems:** Covers various functional areas like content management, collaboration tools, user authentication, data analytics, and DevOps automation.
* **Technology Stack:** Incorporates tools for monitoring, logging, data visualization, and insights generation.

#### **Monitoring Framework**

* Uses **Prometheus** for application monitoring and alerting.
* **Grafana** serves as the visualization tool for monitoring metrics.
* Persistent metric storage is achieved via Kubernetes volumes.
* Alert notifications can be configured for email or Slack.

#### **Logging Framework**

* Logs from microservices, system files, and VMs are processed through tools like FluentBit, FileBeat, and Logstash.
* ElasticSearch is used for log storage and indexing.
* Kibana facilitates log visualization and dashboard creation.

#### **Data Insights**

* Telemetry events are processed through a pipeline that extracts, deduplicates, validates, and enriches data.
* **Druid** is used for analytics storage, with visualization handled by Superset.
* Reports include trends and usage patterns like content plays, user sessions, and page views.

#### **Kubernetes Integration**

* Manages both containerized and non-containerized workloads.
* Features auto-scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Cluster Autoscaler.
* Provides dashboards for monitoring API performance, resource usage, and scaling events.

#### **Dashboards**

* Dashboards monitor various metrics, such as system health, job availability, and log trends.
* Key exporters include Node, Redis, Kafka, and Elasticsearch.

#### **Deployment and Backup**

* Framework deployment involves Kubernetes-based monitoring and logging stacks.
* Database backup procedures include repositories for Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j, and others.

#### **Purpose**

* Enables comprehensive monitoring and logging for scalable and reliable infrastructure.
* Supports auditing, error tracking, and performance optimization across subsystems.

The document also provides repository links and emphasizes the community-driven nature of the project, encouraging contributions and reuse.
