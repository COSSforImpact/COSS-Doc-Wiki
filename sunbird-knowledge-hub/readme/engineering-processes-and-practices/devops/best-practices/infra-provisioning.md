# Infra Provisioning

### Overview

#### Key Components and Focus Areas:

1. **Cost Optimization**:
   * Focused on optimizing resources based on utilization.
   * System tuning for maximum performance and throughput.
2. **Quality Assurance**:
   * Emphasis on code quality analysis, quality gates, and automated tests.
3. **Security**:
   * Implements best practices for network and application security.
   * Includes RBACs (Role-Based Access Control), hardware/software hardening, DevSecOps, and penetration testing.
4. **Automation**:
   * Adopts continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
   * Utilizes "Configuration as Code" and container orchestration.
5. **Observability**:
   * Includes robust monitoring, alerting, log analytics, and metrics tracking.
6. **Infrastructure**:
   * Designed for resilient, scalable infrastructure for cloud and on-premise data centers.
   * Emphasizes "Infrastructure as Code" and business continuity.

#### Infrastructure Blueprint:

The infrastructure includes Kubernetes clusters and a wide array of technologies such as Cassandra, Elasticsearch, Keycloak, Kafka, Redis, Neo4J, Postgres, and object storage. The stack integrates tools like Ansible for provisioning, Helm charts for packaging microservices, and Jenkins pipelines for deployment.

#### Tools and Practices:

* **Deployment**: Uses Ansible, Helm charts, Jenkins pipelines, and Terraform.
* **Configuration**: All scripts and configurations are version-controlled.
* **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data.

#### Cost Estimates:

* Base infrastructure setup: Approximately ₹80,000.
* Infrastructure to support 25,000 transactions per second (TPS): Around ₹7 crore.

#### Additional Highlights:

* Focus on disaster recovery and business continuity.
* Integration of advanced telemetry, analytics, and discussion tools in the system.

This document serves as a technical and financial blueprint for deploying and managing a robust infrastructure for modern applications.
