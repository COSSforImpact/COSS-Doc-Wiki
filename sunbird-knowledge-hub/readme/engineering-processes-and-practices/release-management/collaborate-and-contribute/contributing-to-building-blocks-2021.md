# Contributing to Building Blocks (2021)

### Overview

1. **Overview and Structure:**
   * Sunbird is an open-source platform configured to meet specific needs (e.g., DIKSHA, iGOT).
   * Custodians and contributors have distinct roles. Custodians curate contributions, while contributors develop and maintain code for the long term.
   * Core principles include systematic planning, collaborative development, testing, and maintenance.
2. **Release Process:**
   * **Stages:** Plan, Develop, Consolidate, and Communicate.
   * Milestones include scope finalization, development, code freeze, release certification, and post-release updates.
   * Defined workflows ensure alignment with architecture, coding standards, and testing protocols.
3. **Contributor Responsibilities:**
   * Ensure compatibility with existing systems.
   * Follow detailed technical designs, coding, and integration standards.
   * Create and update comprehensive documentation and test cases.
   * Address and report issues through designated tools like JIRA.
4. **Custodian Responsibilities:**
   * Oversee repositories, maintain environments, and ensure contributions align with Sunbird guidelines.
   * Manage branching, merging, and release cycles.
   * Perform comprehensive testing, including regression and integration.
5. **Onboarding and Collaboration:**
   * New contributors undergo a structured onboarding process, including learning, interaction, and hands-on enhancement cycles.
   * Weekly tactical calls and fortnightly strategic discussions ensure synchronization between contributors and custodians.
6. **Key Tools and Processes:**
   * Utilizes platforms like JIRA, GitHub, and Confluence for task tracking, code management, and documentation.
   * Test and deployment phases involve both contributors and custodians to ensure system reliability.
7. **Customization for Adopters:**
   * Adopters, such as DIKSHA, handle their deployment and user acceptance testing (UAT).
   * Critical issues are addressed in coordination with custodians and contributors for timely resolution.

The document emphasizes collaborative workflows, stringent adherence to guidelines, and robust communication mechanisms to maintain the integrity of the Sunbird ecosystem.
