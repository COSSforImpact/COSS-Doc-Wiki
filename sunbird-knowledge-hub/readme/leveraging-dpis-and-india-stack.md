### Slide Overview:-

The PDF titled "Leveraging DPIs & India Stack" provides an overview of how India's Digital Public Infrastructures (DPIs) are being utilized to drive innovation at scale. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Concept of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)

* DPIs are compared to physical public infrastructures like roads and electricity.
* Global examples include the Internet and Email, with India's digital systems serving as pillars for innovation.

2. India's DPI Pillars:

* Identity: Aadhaar, a unique digital identity system designed for security and privacy. It includes biometric data (fingerprints, iris scans) and is used for various services like e-signatures and digital lockers.
* Payments: UPI and Aadhaar-based payment systems enable inclusive and interoperable financial transactions.
* Data Empowerment: Data sharing is facilitated through consent-driven, encrypted mechanisms such as the Account Aggregator system, which allows users to share financial data securely with service providers.

3. Applications of DPIs:

* PAN Verification: NSDL-powered API for validating PAN numbers, which is essential for onboarding and KYC processes.
* Education: DIKSHA platform by NCERT offers access to educational materials freely licensed for public use.
* Healthcare: ABDM provides digital infrastructure for healthcare services, including health facility registries, ABHA numbers, and other services.

These systems are designed to be interoperable, secure, and privacy-preserving, driving growth in various sectors such as finance, education, and healthcare.
