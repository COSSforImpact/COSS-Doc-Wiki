{% embed url="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Or7B8Rbv8qC0vOGSgW0HrhHpWHpu7RxEOLl22ap5d0g/edit?usp=sharing" %}

### Overview

The document titled "Taxonomy" focuses on Sunbird's taxonomy system, a structured approach to organizing knowledge and enhancing searchability for educational content. Key elements include:

1. **Taxonomy Structure**: The taxonomy is divided into universal knowledge and expert knowledge, which helps organize and navigate content effectively. Examples include frameworks like the K12 National Curriculum Framework (NCF), AP SCERT, and the EkStep Concept Map, all designed to aid discovery and access to relevant content.
2. **Vocabulary and Localization**: Vocabulary within the taxonomy includes terms with meanings, synonyms, and translations across multiple languages, such as Kannada, Hindi, and Telugu. This multilingual approach ensures content accessibility for teachers and students in their native languages, making search and understanding more user-friendly.
3. **Framework Characteristics**:
   * **Multiplicity and Modularity**: Different experts can design purpose-driven frameworks. These modular structures allow for growth and the extension of frameworks, with no need for consensus, so that multiple frameworks can coexist.
   * **Localization**: States and institutions can develop frameworks tailored to local needs, providing flexibility in content organization.
   * **Hierarchical Categorization**: The taxonomy enables hierarchical categorization, where concepts like place value and addition are linked based on grade level, prerequisites, and assessments, creating a structured learning journey.

This taxonomy system on Sunbird supports simplified content discovery, customization, and accessibility, allowing educators and learners to navigate and understand educational content according to their specific needs and language preferences.
