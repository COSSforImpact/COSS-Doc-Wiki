### Slide Overview:-

These slides emphasizes the role of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in driving large-scale innovation and inclusion. DPI refers to a set of shared digital utilities powered by interoperable standards and operated under enabling laws, aimed at providing equal access and addressing sovereignty. These infrastructures are built on digital building blocks, fostering competition, inclusion, and innovation, and operate with open and transparent governance.

The document highlights India's success story with DPI, focusing on the country's journey to address access, choice, and equity at scale. Some of the major components of India's DPI initiatives include:

1. Aadhaar: A foundational digital identity system with over 1.35 billion IDs issued, facilitating large-scale ID-linked services.
2. Unified Payments Interface (UPI): A real-time payment infrastructure that supports interoperability across banks, wallets, and apps, driving billions of transactions monthly.
3. Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT): A system through which over $322 billion has been transferred directly to recipients, reducing financial exclusion and enabling efficient subsidy disbursement.
4. Account Aggregator (AA): A protocol-driven, secure financial data network enabling individuals to consent to share their financial

data for accessing loans and other services, enhancing credit access for small businesses.

India's DPI approach has promoted inclusion, innovation, and sovereignty, offering a model for other nations. The document also advocates for a global financial internet (Finternet) led by G20 members, where each country can have its own sovereign, interoperable real-time financial network.
