# People + Building For Billions: Fireside Chat

In this fireside chat between Mr. Nandan Nilekani and Dr. Pramod Varma, Mr. Nilekani spoke about the concept of DPI which was the outcome of market innovation; digital foundations backed by public investment. He further maintained that a strong DPI strategy should always account for societal capacities for inclusive growth and address future needs. The development of the Aadhaar, UPI, and DBT digital public goods are good examples of such a strategy. The conversation emphasised on eliminating language and transaction barriers through digital technology and AI. Mr. Nilekani also felt that the fundamentals of a strong DPI system was created by adopting the right bundle of technology, funding and policy and that faster DPI adoption would aid countries in achieving their SDG goals by 2030.
