About ShikshaLokam :

ShikshaLokam is an Education Leadership Platform under the aegis of Shibulal Family Philanthropic Initiative. It is a manifestation of Societal Platform thinking, a systematic method to resolve complex societal challenges with speed, at scale, sustainably.

As a platform for education leadership, ShikshaLokam offers open-source technology capabilities and resources to a variety of ecosystem players, including Individuals, NGOs, and Government. ShikshaLokam aims to do so in ways that support education leadership development at a large scale with high impact.

Samiksha is a module of ShikshaLokam that equips users to create their own framework to assess education institutions such as schools, anganwadi and individuals of the system including HMs, teachers and other officials. You can generate reports, analyse data and draw insights.

Unnati enables users to undertake a set of action projects with a specific objective in a specified period of time. Education leaders can use Unnati to create projects, invite other people such as collaborators, assign timelines, execute and monitor progress.
