## **Leveraging India's Digital Rails for Micro & Nano Entrepreneurs**

### **Challenges and Opportunities**

* **Demographic Landscape**: With 25 million individuals reaching working age annually, India requires 15 million jobs per year. Nano entrepreneurs form a critical component, as MSMEs account for a significant percentage of businesses and jobs.
* **Sectoral Struggles**: Nano businesses (e.g., food stalls, salons, repair shops) face challenges like:
  * Limited access to credit, markets, and compliance support.
  * Digital literacy gaps and dependency on cooperative banks not equipped for digital operations.
  * High expectations for free services and immediate outcomes.
* **Impactful Interventions**: DeAsra Foundation supports over 275,000 businesses through partnerships, tailored services, and platforms offering 75–100 tools for entrepreneurs.

**Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Support Systems**

* DPI presents opportunities to formalize and strengthen nano businesses, similar to Udyog Aadhaar initiatives.
* Customizable platforms cater to rural and urban needs, requiring local partnerships and domain expertise for effective implementation.
* Key focus areas include:
  * Bridging the digital gap for nano entrepreneurs.
  * Providing access to modular, scalable digital tools.
  * Addressing grassroots challenges through innovative solutions.

**Expanding Reach Through Partnerships**

* Collaborations with organizations like GSBA and Swami Bharati help scale impact.
* Tailored playbooks and resources guide entrepreneurs in setting up and scaling businesses.
* Efforts extend to agriculture and other sectors via localized initiatives.

**Future Directions**

* DeAsra emphasizes the importance of data-driven strategies for regulatory and operational improvements.
* Promotes inclusivity by offering resources for disabled entrepreneurs and working with specialized NGOs.
* Aims to inspire innovation through hackathons and solution-building for specific entrepreneur groups.

**Vision**

By addressing fundamental challenges and enabling access to digital infrastructure, DeAsra and similar initiatives aim to create sustainable livelihoods and contribute to India’s goal of generating 15 million jobs annually through micro and nano entrepreneurship.
