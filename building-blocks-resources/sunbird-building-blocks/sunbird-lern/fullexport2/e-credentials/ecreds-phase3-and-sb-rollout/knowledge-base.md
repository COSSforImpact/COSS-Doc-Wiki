# Knowledge base

These are listed for informational and educational purposes only. Sunbird [github specification](https://github.com/sunbird-specs/inCredible/blob/master/v1/spec.md#recipient) is quite different from OpenBadges and not all procedures/language may be applicable. For example, inCredible spec doesn't recommend 'baking' of a certificate image, whereas OpenBadges does. So, please tread these with some caution.
