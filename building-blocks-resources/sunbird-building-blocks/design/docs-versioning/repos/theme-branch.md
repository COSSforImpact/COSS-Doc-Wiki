# theme branch

* This branch will contain the Jekyll code
  * HTML layouts for pages and sidebars etc
  * plugins
* Purpose of maintaining it separately is that code is maintained at one place and consumed with all branches during the build.&#x20;
* Commit id will be inserted in the footer with the text "Build from commit \<commit-id>" so that info is available from which commit it was build
