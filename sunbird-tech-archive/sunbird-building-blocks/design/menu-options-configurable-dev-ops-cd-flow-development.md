# Menu options configurable - Dev-Ops CD flow development

### **Introduction:** <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-introduction" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-introduction"></a>

Makes chatbot menu options configurable so it can easy to maintain without a dev engineer. So we can add/edit existing menu options. It has the following advantages:

* It will help with a faster deployment process.
* Quick change based on the requirement and easy to deploy.
* Any time/ anyone(authorized) / any flow/menu text can change quickly.
* Add/Edit change the text for Menu options.

### **Problem statement:** <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-problemstatement" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-problemstatement"></a>

As a solution owner, I would want to deploy menu options faster without having to depend on a release on both portal and WhatsApp with the following details -

1. Able to change the text
2. Able to change the menu options (Add/edit/remove)
3. Able to create new flows/structure such as introducing new menu options which are not there
4. Able to change answers to queries
5. Able to add/edit/remove hyperlinks
6. Able to analyze the data after changes

### **Key Design Problems:** <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-keydesignproblems" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-keydesignproblems"></a>

1. How to upload a local file to blob storage.
2. Versioning and rollback for files.
3. Secure (Only authorized users can access)

#### **Solution 1:** <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-solution1" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-solution1"></a>

Using Jenkins job where we can upload a file while build and deploy of the job.

Download and upload files from blob through Jenkins with the following process

* Only the owner/authorized user can log in to Jenkins.
* Using Jenkins azure plugins we can parameterize the build.
* We can choose which file from local and upload in specified blob storage.
* Build a chatbot with a new configuration.
* Upload artifact and deploy.

**Pros:**

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) Easy to maintain, add, and modify any time Menu options and query answers just by uploading the JSON object.

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) We can keep/maintaining all versions of files.

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) It will help to revert back to the old version of files if something went wrong with the new version of files.

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) It's secure since the only authorized user can upload and download.

#### **Solution 2:** <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-solution2" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-solution2"></a>

Create a separate application for accessing and modifying the file.\
User onboard via API(backend)\
Share credentials with user

For creating the files in a blob it requires azure services keys.

**Pros:**

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) Easy to create and update config JSON using APIâ€™s

```
Create
{{host}}/chatbot/config/create
Update
{{host}}/chatbot/config/update
```

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) For every new update, it will create a new file with a version number.

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) Easy to roll back to the older version.

![(plus)](../../../.gitbook/assets/add.png) Since it is a login based app so only an authorized person only can do.

#### Chatbot download/update configurations and build process: <a href="#menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-chatbotdownload-updateconfigurationsandbuildprocess" id="menuoptionsconfigurable-dev-opscdflowdevelopment-chatbotdownload-updateconfigurationsandbuildprocess"></a>

Enable load and execute config from AZURE container for a chatbot.

* Make literals and chart flow configurable.
* Keep files in blob storage public accessible.
*   While doing a build for chatbot/router run the below commands in the docker file

    ```
    FROM node:10.19.0 as builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . /app

    ADD http://source.file/config/literals  /config/literals.js 
    ADD http://source.file/config/chatflow  /config/chatflow.js
    RUN npm install

    FROM node:10.19-slim
    COPY --from=builder /app .
    EXPOSE 4000 8443
    CMD [ "node", "appRest.js" ]
    ```
* For every build, it will download it from the blob and add it `/router/config/*` files.
* So now we can change only those required files and do build and deploy
