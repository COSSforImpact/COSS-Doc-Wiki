#### What is Manage Learn? <a href="#hp6nmiee6644" id="hp6nmiee6644"></a>

Manage Learn is a vertical within the Sunbird project that focuses on implementing project and and survey capabilities. This capability currently is enabled using multiple building blocks such as Sunbird Obsrv, Sunbird RC, Sunbird Lern, Sunbird Ed and Sunbird Knowlg. Below are the solutions offered through Manage learn vertical.

* Programs
* Project
* Survey
* Observation with Rubric
* Observation without Rubric
* Observation led Improvement project

#### What is an entity? <a href="#mcfkjgfvam14" id="mcfkjgfvam14"></a>

Entities refer to any different types of records within the location master e.g. states, districts, blocks, schools, and clusters. In the context of Manage Learn these resources are marked to be relevant for users belonging to various entities.

#### What is Observation? <a href="#szmtlre0rjml" id="szmtlre0rjml"></a>

Observations consist of questionnaires tailored for specific entities like school blocks or clusters. Users with roles as Teachers, HT and officials can record observations whenever needed and access them accordingly. On Manage Learn, Content Creators have the capability to create three types of observations.

For More details refer below link\
[https://diksha.gov.in/help/observations/overview/index.html](https://diksha.gov.in/help/observations/overview/index.html)

[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nOswAk7\_b5DpqfKP5MvN\_rH2UersACecECzzoHzu0Vk/edit#slide=id.g13ee324dd2e\_0\_107](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nOswAk7\_b5DpqfKP5MvN\_rH2UersACecECzzoHzu0Vk/edit#slide=id.g13ee324dd2e\_0\_107)

*
  1. Observation with rubrics

The questionnaire is straightforward and does not include any domains.

*
  1. Observation without rubrics

Creators have the flexibility to define particular domains, criteria, and scores for each Observation. Based on the scores users get on taking up an Observation, they are shown the level (L1, L2, L3) their school is at concerning the Observation that was conducted. Any logged-in user can use the Observations.

*
  1. Observation led Improvement project

#### What is a Project? <a href="#c2d2nb2tdhmo" id="c2d2nb2tdhmo"></a>

The improvement project empowers leaders to outline and monitor a series of tasks, guiding users toward achieving specific improvement objectives. These projects are accessible to users with roles as Teachers, HT (Head Teacher), and Officials in their profiles. The project is broken down into actionable micro-tasks, and relevant learning resources are incorporated into these tasks. Content creators on Manage Learn have the authority to create and manage such improvement projects.

#### What is a Survey? <a href="#id-9wcqoaydz2sh" id="id-9wcqoaydz2sh"></a>

Surveys on the DIKSHA Application are designed to gather valuable opinions and feedback from users without being associated with any specific entity. Participants can only take the survey once, using it as a platform to provide feedback, share information, or contribute ideas related to events, activities, or processes. Creators have the flexibility to define a time limit for the surveys, after which access to the form is restricted. However, data submitted by users before the expiration remains accessible for review and analysis, ensuring valuable insights are retained for decision-making and improvement purposes.

1. What is a Program?

A Program enables organizations to define, run and track a set of related activities to achieve a specific set of goals, with precise tracking of progress and completion. A Program is time-bound with a defined start and end for completion. A Program can be targeted to multiple sets of target users. A Program consists of different activities such as - taking a set of surveys, doing a set of improvement projects, taking a set of observations, etc. Each activity within a Program can have its own set of target users and a defined schedule.

[https://diksha.gov.in/help/programs/overview/index.html](https://diksha.gov.in/help/programs/overview/index.html)

1. What is Observation led Improvement?

These are Observations with rubrics with Improvement Projects mapped to each level. Users get suggestions for starting an Improvement Project based on the level they are at after completing the Observation.

1. What is Observation as a task inside a Project?

In an improvement project, observations can be included as tasks. To successfully complete the improvement project, users must fulfill the observation task in addition to other assigned tasks. The completion of observations, along with the fulfillment of other tasks, is essential to achieving the project's overall objectives and ensuring a comprehensive approach to the improvement process.

1. Who are the Program Stakeholders?
   1. Program Designer

As a Program Designer, you can access reports like Task Detail report for resources, Status Report for projects, and Question Report for surveys and observations (with and without rubrics). While using these reports, you can apply filters based on program, resource, district, organization, start date, and end date for better analysis and planning. However, some reports may be password protected to ensure data confidentiality and privacy.

*
  1. Program Manager

As a Program Manager, you have access to reports such as Task Detail report for resources, Status Report for projects, and Question Report for surveys and observations (with and without rubrics), allowing you to utilize various filters like program, resource, district, organization, start date, and end date for data analysis and decision-making. Some reports may be password protected for added security.

2. Service setup guide\
   **Clone the service repository onto your system**

* Create a new folder where you want to clone the repository.
* Navigate to that directory using the terminal.
* Execute the git commands to clone the repository using the provided link from the code tab.

Git link

https://github.com/shikshalokam/ml-projects-service.git

command to clone

git clone https://github.com/shikshalokam/ml-projects-service.git

#### **Create .env file** <a href="#rufjdnmbhjbs" id="rufjdnmbhjbs"></a>

Create a file named .env and copy the environment-specific data corresponding to that service into the .env file.

#### **Install Dependencies** <a href="#agbyjtludu8f" id="agbyjtludu8f"></a>

To install dependencies from a package.json file in Visual Studio Code, you can use the integrated terminal. Here are the steps:

* Open the integrated terminal by going to View > Terminal or using the shortcut Ctrl+\` (backtick).
* In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the package.json file is located.
* Run the command npm install or yarn install, depending on your preferred package manager.
* The package manager will read the package.json file and install all the dependencies specified in it.
* Wait for the installation process to complete. You should see progress indicators or a success message for each installed dependency.
* Once the installation is finished, the dependencies listed in the package.json file will be installed in a node\_modules directory in your project.

#### **Setting the keycloak** <a href="#j9hfhkgo9vho" id="j9hfhkgo9vho"></a>

* Create a folder on service directory named: keycloak-public-keys
* Inside that folder create a file GRxxx....................xxxxx60fA

for keycloak file please contact Backend Team

#### **Setup Database** <a href="#id-2icybn1t2zuf" id="id-2icybn1t2zuf"></a>

Before proceeding with these steps, ensure that you have MongoDB installed on your computer. For a graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB, you can choose to install Robo 3T.

* Obtain the latest database dump from the backend team.
* Restore the database in your local environment using the following command:\
  For Windows/Linux: mongorestore \<name you want to give the db> \<directory or file to restore>\
  For macOS: mongorestore -d \<name you want to give the db> \<directory or file to restore>

Note: Add \<name you want to give the db> to mongoDB url in .env file.

1. DB Schema\
   The schema serves as a blueprint for creating and maintaining the database that supports the ML projects services data storage and retrieval operations.
